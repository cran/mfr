\title{
Minimal free resolutions for special graphs.
}
\description{
Compute minimal free resolutions for special graphs for which the
resolutions are known and do not require complex calculations.
}
\usage{
MFRComplete(n)
MFRCompleteBipartite(n,m)
MFRCycle(n)
MFRbwg(spokes)
MFRStar(n)
MFRWheel(n)
}
\arguments{
  \item{n}{
order of the graph. In the case of a wheel graph, n must be odd.
In the case of a complete bipartite graph, this is the number of vertices
in the first group.
}
  \item{m}{
number of vertices in the second group of the complete bipartite graph.
}
  \item{spokes}{
number of spokes in the broken wheel graph.
}
}
\details{
For some graphs, the minimal free resolution is known.
\code{mfr} checks for some of these and uses the known formulas,
but we include them as directly callable here.
\code{MFRComplete} computes the MFR of a complete graph.
Similarly for \code{MFRCompleteBipartite},
\code{MFRCycle}, \code{MFRPath}, \code{MFRStar}
and \code{MFRWheel}. 
\code{MFRbwg} computes the MFR of a broken wheel graph.
Note that \code{MFRWheel} is a special case:
it is closed form only if \code{n} is odd. So this function should only
be called if \code{n} is odd.
}
\value{
a minimal free resolution, as returned by \code{mfr}.
